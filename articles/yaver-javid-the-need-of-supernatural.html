                Science [note a] is a strictly naturalist discourse. Being a strictly naturalist discourse, if supernatural exists it is bound to reject it even if it sees it. It's not a problem because an honest scientist will immediately throw the discourse and accept the truth but it is a huge problem when theorizing about something. Because science among the people has gained a lot of trust people will prefer the scientific theories even if they are just the last resort of scientists to explain using naturalistic explanations. Science has a very powerful tool that i coined as Tycogenesism. It is to just say it happened by a mere chance. Try this Tycogenesism in bazaar you would know what status it posses. Does this Tycogenesism exist? Yes it does, evolution might be just partially but origin of life is screamingly Tycogenesistic. It is clear that science has this major flaw. But it should also be understood that it is very important tool for humanity, all we have to do is to teach the flaws of this discourse to the students and make it clear to them.

                Now, the new question that arises is that is there any way to reach the supernatural? It's clear that the metaphysical philosophy of last 2500 years is just pure imagination or it also could be easily said that "all human philosophy is imaginary i.e. pure speculation". What should we do in this regard. In our religion, Islam, every mechanism that is unknown we are dictated to say god does it. It's clear that it is to avoid superstition. Yeah normally where we expected scientific laws to be in place we might say that there are unknown laws in place since it's not superstition. In scientific discourse we should better accept our limits and rather than doing this Tycogenesistic behavior we should say it's "unexplainable right now" but where it's reasonably clear that no amount of advancement will ever provide a way to explain it naturally, science should declare it "unexplainable by science" and leave.

                The knowing of supernatural must come from somewhere which has tools to access it. It's clear we don't posses those tools. But in the religion islam or secularly the religion of prophets which includes the Islam[note b], Christianity, Judaism etc. there comes message from a source which knows the supernatural and natural alike. If anyone accepts the religion on the basis of logic then for him there is a chance these concepts will be cleared. But for the others they have to just accept defeat. In our religion these things are not said for anything but for argumentation. It has a incomplete set of supernatural explanations. Hence sometimes Muslims might have to accept defeat as well. Or maybe there are only few and every single explains just by chance came into it.
