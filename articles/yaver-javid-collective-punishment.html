            <p>When the first shot was fired in Kashmir they said "it will not stop until the day of judgement." How wrong were they.</p>
            <p>Despite all things saying it shouldn't stop, it is stoppable. How? Using collective punishment of course! There is always a group of people that when they see the oppression they fight back: by words and by guns. They can't be broken for death is not scary to them especially when they believe in hereafter.</p>
            <p>You may break them by torture but not all. But all can be broken by this collective punishment. You fight against oppression, your people will have to suffer. Your family's land is taken away. Your kinship has its dreams crushed. Your friends have their bones crushed. If you're more unfortunate, you are in a jail. Your father has to send dollars to feed you in jail. But little does your sick father know if my son gets out of the jail he won't live a year for jail has done enough to sicken you.</p>
            <p>It works even on magnitude of nations, one person hits with a stone on September 11th, the whole country is destroyed to make an example for the world that whoever messes with the world powers will be harmed in such a scale they won't recover even in a century.</p>
            <p>Don't speak against the foe of humanity, they have found a new technique. Pen is On!</p>
