            <p>The freedom of speech is a peculiar thing for me: one who comes from an Islamic background. In fact, the entire system of rights makes no sense whatsoever. You can do algebra, or as they call it in Urdu jabr o qasr, with the rights. How can such an undefined model be something that rules the world?</p>
            <p>When I look at the phrase “freedom of speech,” the first problem I notice is the word freedom. Does the government have the jurisdiction to put a halt to someone’s freedom? Yes, but only in cases where it is harming wealth, life, or dignity. This is the sole purpose of the government. So, how can it allow the misuse of speech?</p>
            <p>The freedom of expression mandates unconditional freedom to speak whatever you want and hints at government action out of its jurisdiction being permissible if it doesn’t conflict with any established rights. This model of rights is weak and has major problems. The case I want to make is that we need to replace it with something exemplary. The model I have in mind is to create a court that knows its jurisdiction, and its purpose would be to decide if a bill can be passed or not—i.e., to decide whether the law is protecting people’s wealth, life, and dignity. In my model, the court would have no power to reject it on the basis of efficiency, although it must comment.</p>
            <p>You would then need no “freedom of speech” right for speaking the truth or criticizing rightfully. Rightfully so! Pen off!</p>
